#### video Demo : <>

#### description:

cs50 Slyther-in is bascially a simple snake game that we used to play on our dads old keypad phones which was simple but fun to play. 
It's interactive with arrow key on your keyboard




#### Implementation:
Snake size increased by one every time it eats food.
Snake can only change direction at a right angle;
Snake move is controlled by arrow-key(left, right, up, down).
It's not possible to change the direction to the opposite direction;
Game will be over if the snake touches itself.
When the snake crosses the grid boundary, it reappears from the opposite direction.
Grid cell will be filled with color when clicked.
New food will appear in every 3s/4s.
